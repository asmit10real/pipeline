## Refactor current indicators into their own files and create a folder system to organize current files

## Implement generating the 'spreadsheet' of Roaring Kitty's analysis and saving to sql now that calculations are implemented

## Describe Program flow in readme or somewhere?

## Implement getting variables from config.json and making sure all necessary variable changes can happen there
    - How do we handle strategy variables? I understand we can also put the vars in config.json but that would be confusing to a naive
        person that knows nothing about code, right?

        - Like let's say eventually there are 10 different strategies pre-loaded, I can't easily conceptualize how to properly organize
            the vars in config.json in such a way that it's readable to a non-programmer

            Might be obvious to others

## Need to expand on the performance calculations. Currently limited to a few basic calcs

## Want to implement PCA analysis to test strength of different variable values for indicators
