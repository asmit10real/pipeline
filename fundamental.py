        effective tax rate is  divide the income tax expense by the earnings (or income earned) before taxes.

        invested capital is to obtain the working capital figure by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. 
        Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. 
        Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company's fixed assets.
